# William Wang . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a major in Computer Science. I have always been passionate about the technology industry, where breaking new ground, growth, and making creative ideas come true happens every day. I have been able to carry on my passion in the form of creating various apps, and join in multiple developing clubs where I could utilize my critical thinking, leadership, and algorithmic skills which I gained during my undergraduate studies. During my leisure, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and volunteering at local high schools as a teaching assistant or participate in events that are dedicated to helping international students to have a smooth transition from high school into University in a foreign country. By doing this not only can I help others but also develop my communication and interpersonal skills. This is one of the most valued experiences during my study at the University of Toronto.

## Development Projects


Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_william](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo)

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**: Built a Cluster Monitor Agent which is an internal tool that collects the hardware information of each server and monitors resource usage, such as CPU model, memory size, current CPU/memory/disk IO usages in real time. The program is scheduled by Linux crontab every minute, and then insert collected data into a PostgreSQL database provisioned using docker. Wrote some SQL queries to analyze the Linux cluster usage data to help with hardware resource planning and improvement.
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**: Built Grep application using Java that is used to find text pattern in any given file of a directory and then write lines containing a given pattern into a result file. The application takes regex format pattern and path of a given directory with an output file to store the result. It can be used easily to fetch any information that user need in a faster and efficient manner. I also developed another application that connects to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC. With database containing multiple tables to simulate a simple market model between customers and salesmen, with customers having multiple orders including some merchandise. This app will help to query the information of customer's orders based on given order_id and/or other details of the order.

**University of Toronto (2014 - 2019)**, Honours Bachelor of Science, Computer Science

- **2D Puzzle game Salvator:** It is a 2D game developed based on Unity platform. My main contribution was to design some of the core game mechanics by applying C#. And also translated project needs on how to keep players intrigued throughout different levels by adding a story line into the game.

Current website http://dota2armory.herokuapp.com/

- **Android App:** This APP is for physicians and nurses collecting patient records in hospital emergency using Java. I focused on app's algorithm mainly to rank the patients to meet physicians based on multiple factors such as injury level, arrival time to systematically lower the waiting time for each patient as much as possible.
